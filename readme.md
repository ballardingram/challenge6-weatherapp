# Challenge 6 - Weather Dashboard
This website was built to showcase my Server-Side API skills by building a weather dashboard. The site should have the ability to accept text input, retain a search history in local storage, present a five (5) day forecast with the current day predominate on the screen. Each weather card will display "temperature," "feel-like," and "humidity." The current day will also have "wind speed" and a "uv index" that changes color based on the severity of the UV index.

## Built With
This website was built with the standard structure of HTML, CSS, and JS files all referenced appropriately. I pull from JQUERY, Bootstrap, Google Fonts, and FontAwesome for the icons. I used VS Code to write and edit the code. Google Fonts, FontAwesome, and Bootstrap were manipulated to fit a new style.

## Website
You can find the final product at: https://ballardingram.github.io/challenge6-weatherapp/

## Contributions
This was largely and independent project. I used AskBCS at the very end to clarify the weather API Key issue I had. I relied heavily on Bootstrap, JQUERY, and MDN documentation for all other help.

## Observations
This project was exciting because I have always wondered how Server Side API websites worked. Putting one (1) together was a challenge due to the variables and loops, but exciting otherwise. The documentation to use the Weather API was very helpful when getting the attributes.

## Challenges
Now that I have the project coming together, I found that being able to write structured, easy to read, and appropriate code is a lot harder than you would assume. You have to keep things neat and orderly.
