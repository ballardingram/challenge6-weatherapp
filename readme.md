# Challenge 6 - Weather Dashboard
This website was built to showcase my Server-Side API skills by building a weather dashboard. The site should have the ability to accept text input, retain a search history in local storage, present a five (5) day forecast with the current day predominate on the screen. Each weather card will display "temperature," "feel-like," and "humidity." The current day will also have "wind speed" and a "uv index" that changes color based on the severity of the UV index.
